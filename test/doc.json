S. C. I. E. 40 are for November the well was 11/14/2017 when I'm recording this this video will  probably be re shown are for multiple years so  maybe that they won't mean anything to you but that's when we're recording it today this is our special  guest lecture on spam and email filtering are something that professor of in check are has asked me  to put together and I refresh this every couple of years  if you've already been attending my sections as you are our hope you are you should know a little bit  about me I've been doing this for too long I am a experts are I pretend to be an expert at least on  talking shooting and and such I've been right a teaching assistant for a very long time ABA perhaps  most importantly I have spent many years I don't currently do it but I have spent many years managing  industrial scale email systems are with up to like 30000000 email accounts so I have significant experience  dealing with email at an I. S. P. level and so the service check is asked me to come and talk to you  about some of what it takes to manage our email apps that scale and  I think it's a great opportunity for us to look at this a little bit differently it's a great opportunity  to kind of here behind the hood of how your favorite our email system our our provider might work and  indeed many of them especially if you're on the bigger ones they're gonna have their own secret fossel  talkies to about that but the fundamental concepts that I'm going to describe tonight are pretty similar  across  our system here are pretty similar regardless of the provider even if the actual tools of their using  our our our proprietary  so why do I talk about spam because initially professor of infectious asked me to say Hey Joe talk about  you know what scale and you know talk about email at scale is kind of boring you know Hey instead of  one mail server let's set up 30 right now it's it's skills out you know you need load balancers are  going to deal with our replication issues all that stuff and you know what I thought boring you don't  care on because the network class and what is really interesting lease is interesting to me is about  how we define our and defeat the spam epidemic and in many cases have defeated the spam academic keep  in mind that over the last 10 years the amount of spam as as decreased quite significantly thankfully  right to the point that only about 60 percent of messages today are considered spam you don't see them  because they end up in your trash folder or they don't get to it all most users only 0 to a small percentage  of the spam that comes in especially if using a pretty decent now provider OB but 60 percent of the  spare 60 percent messages being spared you're you're thinking wow that's so high and when I started  at this game when I was running it spam accounted for something close to 98 percent of the messages  that came in it was  mind boggling the awful the amount of infrastructure I had to support anti spam was substantially greater  than the amount of infrastructure I had to actually support running email for millions of users right  so this became a big deal for me as well the reasons I got out of the email business because it just  got too expensive but are none the less I'm hoping I can talk to about these techniques  if it wasn't for the work that I did are and the work that many others do  then you're in now would not be a functioning commodity today and the fact that it is as good as it  is is I think a testament to a lot of really smart people working on this problem for a long time I'm  and if you've attended by sections you've probably heard me talk about the tragedy of the Commons I  think I did talk about it this year and the tragedy of the Commons is really where  spam right I I think a spam as one of these tragedies or the Commons is email everyone can use email  and if a couple of spammers start figuring out and they can send out messages there's no impact crater  Commons is  an office wide enough you know everyone has plenty of grass to graze on end of a couple people are cheating  by sending out spam messages well sorry  what  if everyone send out spam or everyone abuses the Commons right and so I think in the comments that you're  grazing coats of one person bring the goat  great that's houses right if if one person brings to go to other cheating the system but the Commons  is fine but if everybody brings 2 goats than the Commons gets overgrazed and ecosystem collapses the  grass isn't growing nobody can feed their goats similarly if everyone sends out spam and spam isn't  that with an email stops becoming a viable method of communicating and then everyone stops using email  and in fact that's where we were if you go back to 2007 or so as damages becomes so terrible  that it was hard to do any real work for you to start  you remember back in those days right at sites better now mostly better now  I'm  before we go there I do want to talk I should just mention definitions right are this is a standard  definition of spam it's still pretty good spam is balk messages that are unsolicited  so if you send in unsolicited message you're not streaming so if I send a message to you just saying  hi I sent a message to my doctor saying Hey I have some I need some advice you know and it hurts when  I do this right those messages are unsolicited I if I send a message to our person asking about an apartment  right that's not so well that might be a solicitor message but it might not be that's fine all that's  fine  messages are often far I run a mailing list for a little league team I run a a form that people can  ask me IT questions right those you know those are fine uses of bulk mailing you know there's an all  employees listed my company football now hopefully no one exposes it to the outside world  hopefully  what are unsolicited bulk mail is  right if you send a message to multiple people and that they didn't ask for it that is spam by the definitions  that where that we're talking about  you might have heard some of these other definitions unsolicited bulk email unsolicited commercial email  I don't care I still say Sam I think Hormel is probably not liking the fact that I still say spam but  they don't personally care because I'm just a small fry never wants to call the spam but  I've given that you will have heard some other terms here I'm  you might be surprised to learn  maybe you aren't because you're human and that you've become cynical and jaded by my conversations on  the last term that's been actually goes back a long way also here's a little bit of the history of you  now on 1960 to 1965 are more the very first email systems that were set up that could actually talk  to multiple computers right there were earlier email systems where you basically sent the message to  Joe and the next time Joe locked into that machine you could see it but in the early 19 sixties and  about internet mail or marketing call if that yet where you could send messages to people on other computers  and if you find some really old our messages  by the use Bangkok addressing right go to this computer that this computer that this computer and I  talked to Joe there as as Kevin interesting system the first network email was invented completely networking  I was 1966 on 1969 email was expanded to work over the arpanet are 1971 the outside was invented before  that I don't know what they did but I was pretty boring 1971 the original mailbox protocol but 1978  same here same here is me I'm trying we're gonna admit that I I was born around the same time as spam  coincidence  I'm not sure 1978 the first fan mail was sent advertising equipment for Jack Digital Equipment Corporation  are here it is  this will be giving a product presentation the newest member of the Texas some 20 family the next system  2020 wow I want to go find out all about this at the Hyatt house in Los Angeles on Tuesday 5/9/1978  oops I'm not born yet this is the first and now I I don't believe they were they were writing in all  caps because they were shouting I think at this point now systems were absent EC and they probably work  all they probably only had caps to work with or maybe they didn't I'm not sure but regardless it is  in all caps and now you can tell your friends you have seen the very first fan mail ever sent and I  hope this makes you interested in the product because now there's hundreds of thousands of other spam  mails I you may have been surprised actually the first band I wasn't for like some herbal supplement  but  back in those days they had they're different interests I think and a different market if you know who  is actually on the internet right if I'm not mistaken this was actually sent just not everyone on the  internet at the time  10 very many I I don't actually know probably in the hundreds but  600 right that I write 600 if I wrote 600 I'm a smart person yes I wrote 600 thank you for reminding  you of my own material on thank you hi name and the real Spanish you started in 1992 as are weak people  got into like AOL and compuserve and prodigy and that sort of thing  I am continue to rise into 2010 and we're now down to 2017 with the Spanish continuing to decline and  here's a nice graph of this actually ends in 2011 I believe so it actually it's quite a bit smaller  now even than not but I like this graph because it actually shows you some of the patterns are a little  bit visibly as different spamming or organizations were temporarily shut down and then they come back  and then they send some more but  I think we're down here now  terms of the amount of spam that sent which is no where I mean look at this that's  yes this is where I was right this is this is the period where I was running now and I picked the wrong  time to be in that business I'll tell you what what it was a good business  actually connecting people you know Sir and it's connecting people  so the big challenge with spam is always of the numbers are huge right even now the numbers are huge  estimated 2200000000000 email messages sent  per day I think that number is higher now but try to find an estimate online you will you'll fail because  they will just give you wildly inaccurate numbers  bottom line is the numbers are pretty big and that spam spam accounts for 60 percent of those then we're  talking pretty big  but we're just hams come from  and the answer is probably not surprising to you because you live  in 2017 and you hear about the stuff on the news it doesn't really come from commercial email systems  although there are some I had some great partnerships over the years with our block mailers and I can  tell you that they were always on the up and up and always dealing with options and and everything I've  I've I've known some that were less legitimate but I never worked with them on a really that accounts  for teeny tiny little swaths of the of the spam  a lot more of the spam comes from historically has come from compromise systems either open mail relay  arm and abused by S. P. right somebody over there really isn't open but somebody's using the Comcast  no relay in order to send out their messages and now the big thing of course  is finance  right and what not so are in the news a lot more today than they were 5 or 6 years ago when I was first  getting into this business or when I was dealing with this stuff  cop what nature you know their compromise systems you running malware on your machine and the people  that wrote them our have to decide what they want your machine to do they probably aren't going to just  trash it although some botnets do maybe they're gonna do that quite mining because that's pretty popular  today but  it out spamming is also a completely valid use of a net for person for interesting definitions of of  valid uses yes Sir  fishing this or as well unsolicited issue is a high  right so a person that is spamming how can have multiple objectives right they're trying to sell you  something  they're trying to hack you in some way like they're trying to get you to go to a compromise system where  to download a update your flash right you know what you know what's popular today and  or they're gonna try it out for you like Hey this is bank of America and you need to update your account  information please click here and you know it's really bank of America.  something something got are you and you know you go there and you've just given a username and password  and good luck getting our money back I so that's fishing fishing is somebody trying to steal your credentials  any type of spam it's actually it's nice because it's a type of spam is relatively easy to detect  for users of the techniques or talk about but none the less is still  important  and these guys are the enemy I I'm I don't even remember which website is still this from but if you  are a business and you want to do in a marketing there's plenty of company should go to and they'll  help manager often less and they'll help to make sure that you are complying with a local regulations  and you know  more power to you are not the enemy they may sock right or they may not I don't know but at the end  of the day what I cared about was not these guys I cared about those giant bought not so strange systems  I'm I I I talk a little bit about the apartments are ready but they do bring up an interesting question  and one that increasingly has been answered with yes  what now that's what often times we used to send email by basically just  our acting  acting as a mail relay and sending out messages to remote mailers right so basically your machine is  making outbound connection on port 252 either probably not you're catching mail server catching a server  probably not your local now relay possibly you are are probably just out there to the world on  and a long time ago this was much more productive because port 25 outbound was open I'm a lot more espys  there are blocking port 25 out bound or even if they don't block 425 south bound they are secretly putting  a mail filter and I'll talk about that a little bit more later on but it does break things like the  and that model because now we have to defend or something and what not and so we've lost you know something  is really a core part of what it means to be on the internet or what used to me to be on the internet  which is the end to end principle  I'm I I see the bottom for first use for Spanish 2001 but  the size of those apartments are tiny compared to what the size of our that's our connect and even the  bot notes that I dealt with 5 or 6 years ago are tiny compared to the one that's that exists today the  Putnam city this today especially impacting things like internet of things devices are just you know  millions of Linksys not Linksys routers but white wifi routers of various stripes or compromise a bowl  of many of them I thought now it's like you could go on about you could be running about in your house  you're you're hopefully not but the point is the button after so much larger now and they're being used  for all sorts of nefarious things about spamming is just a small part  lot of hacking attempts go through what notes that sort of thing  so I put up here a couple of ideas of you know what the stamp cost you I think this is pretty much common  sense you know cost network and with this space processor cycles and lost time I'm the most recent assessment  I could find is from 2004 2004 is completely useless to us but they said 20 2000000000 I assume today  that are that number is awesome is remembers probably larger because a lot more people care about you  now but then again we are also a lot more successful in dealing with the spam problem are that we were  at the time and as I said when I ran a a large email provider and it was a I mean it was 1 of the largest  providers in the country probably top 10  maybe top 20 at the at the at the most some of the ISPs are the 2 accounts for their customers or or  larger  well as larger you know those are things I can tell you that are 3 or 4 times as much infrastructure  was spent in dealing with spam that was actually sent in dealing with male and if I can just figure  out a way to get rid of the spam I could have made that service profitable but in the end of the day  I couldn't make it profitable so I didn't keep running it but  yeah  this is the way the cookie crumbles right  so dealing with spam is hard because there is no silver bullet are we adopted what what we would consider  a layered approach and good news for this class right obviously reproach includes a lot of network related  techniques so we're gonna cover them in layers are but the key idea is that you need to block spam early  because the further it gets in your network the more it costs and  there's risks involved in that  but I bought my is a further kits and the more cost I'm I asked the question where should you be dealing  with family this is really a like one of those rhetorical questions like the classical question is where  should you build security and your application and the answer is everywhere right you needed security  the car at the severity of the server in security the network on the same issue with with email I'm  you do need to be dealing with spam prevention at the at the center at the I. S. P. level at the at  the incoming mail level are you need to be dealing with it everywhere  but you know from my perspective I don't have the ability to control the mail clients so I was really  just dealing with that are you know from what I could deal with that I which was at the network level  R. and that the MTA level  I said the network level is how do I stop now from coming in and actually getting into my systems if  I need to actually open up and read the SMTP headers and that point I figured I'd failed because of  the amount of processing power required to process the MTA based systems are orders of magnitude more  than the amount of processing are required in order to handle the network level systems are in some  of the network level systems by the way are a little bit gray well they're great for a couple reasons  because they they start to get into the SMTP hunters but they don't actually need to look at the content  of the message you'll see because this is why we call it in layers  on  barber you meet you may be right but I I'm not gonna sit on video  the first phase is networking  are you need to block the message as early as possible right so as soon as the message gets in your  system are you  are you lose right you have to process that you have to deal with that you you're taking the band with  your checking or whatever and the old an old one way to do this is a blockless  I'm I don't know if we talk about firewalls yet in this are  session but I mean essentially these are access control list basically I've noticed that this I. P.  address out there in the world is sending a spam message I'm going to mark that I'm never going to accept  a message from an I SP from that I. P. again  and I adore black it's like having a car right so think well you know 29202251 got 70 send spam block  right now and I hope you don't get a cover all the reality is that you can't manage a system like this  artist billions of IP addresses millions of IP addresses that are that might send spam some my P. addresses  send spam some of the times and don't send spam other times and there's all sorts of systems are all  sorts of reasons why this doesn't work I'm not the least of which is you can never keep up right in  our history blocking people all the time on  so I knew technique was invented off of the call real time block west  and a real time block list is essentially an organization that's out there that's working to catalog  stammers known spamming please and divide you a database of those spamming appease and the databases  power using the DNS protocol because it's nice and easily castable everyone supports that center  and so these systems are and they get their information a whole bunch of different ways I talk about  some of the ways they get their info are are like firewall rules you can look up on the fly  also if you hook up one of these real time block list to your mail server anytime it gets a message  from a machine that's in their database it's gonna be rejected and so to go back and take the bingo  model again suddenly you're no longer just one guy having your cards you don't have an entire bingo  hall of old ladies are blocking spammers as fast as they can right so you're you're you're blocking  out hundreds and hundreds of I. P. addresses a second in some cases and you're removing old ones and  it's a very adaptive are sort of thing now maybe you don't like this metaphor of old ladies that big  cards that's fine maybe you're a little bit more of a geek and if you are a geek I like to frame it  this way  never seen Voyager right in there fighting the Borg and you know they need some stupid techno babble  the thing and so then the Borg tax rates are how they defend it well they rotate their show frequencies  I don't know what that means either but the sense of the word after attacks to Voyager shields the Voyager  adapt their shields to the Borg attack and it becomes a push and pull on so that's how they're able  to defeat the Borg even though they're 1 ship millions of light years from home without the ability  to get repairs are run out of photon torpedoes or anyway Voyager Sopris Hey I mean it's like 1020 years  old now it's it's part of our but the bottom line is if your geek baby like this I mean essentially  what is a real time block last but you are building a shield and not shield is gonna be adopted in real  time based on other people receiving mail around the world saying which are which addresses are bad  which ones are sending spam right now I'm I haven't seen Star Trek discovery yeah they might favor rotate  the shivering see somebody needs let me now  I'm are there's a lot of different DNS feels out there are there's actually a lot fewer than it used  to be  so when I was playing this game on their war are 3 big ones and about 20 small ones that were pretty  reputable nowadays are you got 3 big ones  and maybe there's a couple more that I don't know why but I went through last night and look at all  the NSP also are useless right here he's got 3 calls it was amazing  welcome around anymore  yeah that's because spammers have  maybe a little less successful that's because why bother using you know a free real time blacklisted  there's some good alternatives available right etcetera I'm  the 3 that I think are still pretty good and are still working on their houses is at least at the time  was the most reputable home and they actually categorize their list very well and they were they the  people that I trusted the most Austin content from the call the S. C. B. L. R. and then swords has their  own Lester there are some others you don't need to know them I'm not particularly advertising for these  guys but you know the big white space is the is the list of our real time blockless providers that have  gone out of business in the last 5 years so it's it's quite impressive  DNS B. L. our dearest BL is just the an alternate name for real time blockless or it's a DNS walk last  real time blacklist her the same thing they just happen to use the DNS protocol so some sometimes we'll  see them one and sometimes to see them the other I have I'm using it interchangeably I apologize  I suggest you know Spamhaus are is the one that I personally used a lot I don't know how good they are  today again I don't want to advertise for them but at least you can kind of see the different methods  that they use to build their list they're always very transparent about that are the SPL was all verified  spam sources right using a honey pot I'll talk about honey pots and second XBL was the export blockless  that's the list although a lot not attack  ET L. was the policy block west that is a list of are if you were an I. S. P. out of your Comcast you  could go to spam house and say here are the DHCP ranges war all of my users and Xfinity and the northeast  and Comcast we go to stand also provide them that data and Spamhaus would ensure that all of those network  blocks were included on the P. B. L. because Comcast was in their best interest prevent their customer  so spamming they could do that by blocking out on 425 and other things but they also would notify a  company like Spamhaus included on the list are there's a few other smaller with the statehouse us provide  I think the DDL for domain names  there may be some others but these are not is our common ones and the ones that I had use the most of  the XBL is  I easily are  the largest of them  I'm a honey pot and I got high this is where I got into a lot of trouble  I'm not ashamed to admit that I got into a lot of trouble with this one are basically honey pot is that  they would go out of their house to this and others to this they would you know create an account on  G. mail or create a account on a on a mail server somewhere and they never put it on anything  they never give it out to anyone  and so every mail that arrives at that mailbox right Bob at something.com you knew was somebody that  was just doing a dictionary attack you know our or some some more time to think she knew that I would  be a spammer some of the honey pot I've set up a mail server if I get any mail here I know they're bad  because I've never really generally uses now Sir  or I used to get into a lot of trouble  is that what these guys started doing  are and I don't know how on whether they still do this would probably do is they would take the phone  to dress  so here's an email address that hasn't been used in 5 years that they would work with various vendors  to reactivate those email addresses and you assume that any mail that and I email address that have  been used in 5 years gets is going to be spam  and I used to get blocked all the time on these lessons and I had a great relationship with them because  yes what that model didn't work because people  don't know that their friend George hasn't been on email and 5 shares still gonna randomly send them  and when you deal with involved when you have like 30000000 or whatever number of dealers that I did  someone somewhere is going to send the some old email address and so we just kept getting blocked because  we have such a large volume of people are that the odds of them sending into one of these spam or these  honey pots by mistake was unfortunately a little larger than we might have preferred right and it costs  a lot of problems yes ma'am  yeah  by using the fake love  well I was an I SP right so  so I have thousands millions of people using my system and some of them would send out and so that I  would be Frank only identified as being a spammer  I was also regularly identified as being a spammer for a number of other reasons are largely that people  are using my system to send spam and I thought that a little bit  our  but are there are there are some real legitimate challenges there because I off I offered a free service  the people who come and sign up for an email account or a one time use account of on some of the things  and that had some challenges  so this is what an ASEAN visor looks like if you if you go to the website I'm sure now punch in a pension  I Peter as you can see if your block there's a link there to report I was walking correctly one of them  I think that the RBL is now gone they used to do a a charity thing where if you got blocked you had  to give $100 or something to charity and in their name and then they would unlock you and so that I  ended up giving her a lot of money to charity one year arm so I can get a black eye and our lawyers  did not like that one bit right but  no that was the way it went  I'm so what are some of the risks in terms of using the RBL Venus feels as a personal cure walking with  we ever see them are you're blocking your firewall  you never get to see the mail are you have no idea what's in it I it could be are could be fine right  I'm so for that reason are they recommend that you're not supposed to actually black people based on  these but the reality is everyone walks based on these so you really don't have too much of a choice  maybe less so now that Spanish kind of gone down a bit over the years maybe you can actually process  more but when I was doing this was such a big deal  DNS B. L. does have something within us I it's doing a DNS query in order to looking out so the the  DNS B. L. R. utilizes the DNS protocol in order to service results right that's it instead of inventing  your own protocol they basically just put in the **** and it works just like reverse lookups so they  would reverse the Oct tenth blah blah blah.xandan.house.net and you could look it up and if you got  a record back or text soccer back then you it was blocked if you didn't it wasn't blocked right and  it uses it use the in house as the protocol to deliver something which wasn't you know strictly a domain  name service it just was a convenient method that my big  reliable redundant distributed database  so once you get in then you have a couple more techniques that you can use at this point now we've accepted  it on our network now established a TCP connection to our mail servers and now we have to use a couple  of different techniques and the big one are they got used and is still used today on all these techniques  are still used today  the cold gray listing are so great listing the name comes from  in the battle days you refer to his blacklisting and white listing and so they said okay great listing  nowadays block listing and allowed lists because you know it's it is the technical terms change over  time but still still call great lists and now you don't for quite a color gray well because it used  to be in the middle between a block list and allow last  the goal was to walk as much mail as possible but now you're going to trick the system by using a are  a feature of SMTP essentially if you are receiving mail from a center that you don't trust  you don't accept it  you send back a message that says try again later  if you are a legitimate person for a legitimate male are what are you supposed to do this if you remember  back to the S. and P. P. lecture or my section you queue the message arm you put in the queue you try  again in 5 minutes 30 minutes an hour and the message will go through and when it hits as gray was system  the second time  I looked at all if this message before are they must have cute shorts with Janet  spammers do not queue is the basics are idea behind gray listing this idea that spammers just don't  bother queuing is too expensive for them to do it they might they just know they're building Gatling  guns right they're not building cueing systems and so they don't queue so therefore greatly think is  a very effective way of ensuring that spammers okay their mail through at the cost of some of your messages  are going to take longer to arrive than others  so I use this and it was quite are quite effective arm but you don't want these on every network lock  once you figure out that address is legitimate you generally just stop  running great last I'm a couple other techniques that got little bit less use our center policy frameworks  right this is essentially a method of setting up a special DNS record on your system to say if you see  an email from Harvard.EDU I only once you accept that from this I. P. address right and this is a way  that a spammer could prevent or a company could prevent their domain name for being used to send spam  very effective for fishing of forcing the spammers just  register more domain names so in the end of the day it wasn't a particularly a tremendously  effective method that they deal with certain types of spam pretty well  I'm an office saying of course is an area where there was much more effective  as you can see here an SPF record I just happen to pull Google's this is a little bit older might not  be updated but you can see so if you receive a message from Google.com I want you to know that these  are the only addresses that you're supposed to accept from right anyone else isn't really Google also  that's the primary use of the S. P. after record  I'm a third phase are is actually look at the message content itself and  our  yeah we're getting  we're getting further down the stack so each of these steps is progressively more expensive to run so  once you're getting to the steps you better be pretty sure it's legitimate now are because  this is the stuff is hard so deep deep him which used to be called the main keys are this is a system  that's been adopted by Yahoo Google and others I'm not I didn't check today whether they're still using  this I believe that they are I haven't heard that they stop but I'm not in the email industry quite  as on directly he thanks  I'm a century there is not a private key basic private key signing of of males they're coming through  again so you know that they're coming from the place they say they are once again I I don't find it  is useful for dealing with fox spam  because quite frankly box cameras are gonna be sending from G. mail anyway or could it be spoofing G.  mail they can resist around the main names but none the less is a very effective method for our company  to prevent their own domain names from being used again only if there are configured in 4 sets  the real system and this isn't a network tools so much but I think you should be aware of at the real  system at the end of the day right once you've abandoned everything else or not abandon once you past  everything else he made it on the system you need to have a last ditch effort to find spam and that's  were rules based systems,nd  the rules based systems I pick your spam assassin why because it's free I've used many commercial worldspace  systems and some of them are significantly better than spam assassin some of them are not because some  of them are spam assassin with weeks and then a price tag but that goes on  rules based systems essentially are mail filters don industrial scale with thousands and thousands of  rules that if those rules match  then the message could be spam so basically you have this idea of a rule and a rule has a score on the  what is the rule so here's an example rules and this is  are based on the idea that spammers aren't good HTML or something I just I pulled out of the middle  of the file so did she now includes a form HTML font face is not a word is enough on sizes too large  there's a whole bunch more if if they happen to use strains spellings of the word **** right maybe like  all these rules themselves if if you have too many clothes tags are not necessarily a spammer but if  you have too many clothes tags and you have an email form and you are coming you know your message looks  like this writer has this feature if you add those scores up and if the score reaches a certain threshold  then you say okay your your spam and then you put it in your trash folder or you or you drop that these  guys are adjusting the scores using are using some A. I. technique so they don't just create them on  there's a lot of efforts  they call them spam and ham so the systems take millions of our good messages and spam messages and  they've already know which ones are good and which ones are bad because they free are they pre worked  it and then they run it through these filters and their goal is to make sure that as much spam as possible  is marked as spam well as little ham as possible is incorrectly marked and so all the scores are very  subtly adjusted and you set up your systems to update these rules on a fairly continuous basis as new  spammers Joe I'm positive that the rules that I used to use aren't as useful spams look a lot different  now than they did back then right there there are fewer herbal supplement ads there are less people  putting a spam message followed by a copy of an article from The New York Times it was a big thing for  a while I'm in order to for various systems  there was one spammer that used to put their spam message but under the spam message they would have  like excerpts from Harry potter I found that to be very amusing and it was all done in order to avoid  systems like this  I'm one of the common ways is to look for your roles in a message and if you find a U. R. L. that is  part of a blacklist then you you don't include it right anytime you have a phishing page or something  you probably have a U. R. L. in your mail recently categorize thousands and thousands or millions of  I am fishing you are owls into some databases which you can buy and then you can link those databases  and your rules based system and are you know you're looking to bank of America.com you're probably a  spammer  and this is a pretty good way of dealing with fishing  I'm an after this what you really get into is what I call the annoying user system right I'm I'm rushing  through this a little bit but are  and this is really where a lot of the big secret sauces is today are whenever user moves and message  from to or from the trash folder  your average email system is now starting to learn about that right using different A. I. techniques  in order to know all you know anytime you see a message from your grandmother I shouldn't be putting  that in the spam filter Asian filtering is one common A. I. technique where you know you can give it  a large enough corpus and they can kind of learn what is a spam message versus not a spam message and  you can actually train and by using your activities on the downside of Asian filtering is that it's  very very very very very computationally expensive I had to have it turned off most of the time and  actually  me tell you a story when I first started first started when I was working on this I bought an anti spam  product that was developed by a Korean company  and the Korean company are gave me a pre built basin filter affect the cream company been running this  for years right I was licensing or software they were very proud of this no this basin filter their  nose in it because you know it's magic in a high but it was part of their anti spam products which I  was launching as part of a of a project with them and guess what there are their built invasion database  this tiny little flock which is in South Korea apparently a lot of their spam messages are in English  and it would have a tendency to categorize messages that it's far in English as being more likely to  be spam which for an American email system was not a good  check I ended up having to throw that away and and build something and build something else asa these  things you know you can't you can't overbilled  there's also other things I don't know how much of this is  how much of this is actively being used but there's a protocol called our which a lot of the big mailers  were were using I I wasn't able to confirm whether they're still using this but ours anytime that you  drag a message to your Google trash folder on our if your I. S. P. was subscribed to the our system  they would send you a note that says that somebody just move one of your messages to the spam folder  are and you would never know this by the way unless you're an I. S. P. which is why I'm having a little  difficulty finding out whether they still do it because I'm not an I. S. P. anymore but if you move  a message your spam folder they would send you are they send the send her a message to this our our  protocol which essentially said by the way we think this one is spam and you could let it through and  then they would it would be up to me to try to do something about it  and finally Google and others are in Microsoft primarily are building some really powerful neural networks  around the stop everything that I just talked about they're doing but kind of in the privacy of their  own data centers and I don't know what a lot of it looks like I have a Google does massive crowdsourcing  of of nail on so that if one person marked something as spam anybody also receive that same message  you know what's going on magically moved to the trash you know a certain percentage of the time they  have neural network algorithms that are vastly superior today to what kind of the open source stuff  that I was using a couple years ago and I I believe the open source stuff that still available so I  was a large enough I SP that I could have built some of this but frankly the technology was a little  bit ahead of our of what I was personally capable of writing and so you will find that a lot of the  current mailers out there you know like Microsoft like Google are basically using a I techniques now  in in ways that thought they don't exactly publish armor that's part of the reason that spammers use  being so thoroughly defeated today  and I just want to go through this very quickly I wasn't I. S. P. I. did allow for for for spamming  arm for people to send mail out of my system I had to do a whole bunch of stuff to kind of prevent them  to spamming are one of the things they did was captions right you've seen these nowadays you don't have  to enter the tax yes at the button and it figures out based on your mouse movements that you're probably  a human right there's there's little things that happened today  but capsules was a common way outbound filtering was another way that a lot of ISPs are myself included  did which is if you run your spam filter not only on the messages coming in but the rest just going  out and then anytime you see something that looks like someone sending spam from one of your systems  you while you take it to your views department or whatever it happens to be  how they did recommended that everybody do this but I don't know and practice I suspect Google does  I suspect Microsoft does expect the big players do but again and I can tell you that they do it so I  wasn't really able to verify what the current industry trend is because I don't I don't have a contact  at those companies anymore  the finally  there was a law that was passed a number of years ago and and this is basically it's now 15 years old  so that you can see how apple will it is but this law basically set up rules and so that you can't do  spamming without financial penalties most allies useless it has this massive the fact that it requires  mailers to have  it requires mailers  2 why opt out links and optimize your evil because on the spammers immediately added fake opt out link  solve their messages and then you click on them and they actually add you to a whole bunch more spam  list soft out wings are terrible on it does have a couple of are the advantages the biggest one is that  it than that ISPs could not be held liable for dropping your mail there 5 that we accidentally deleted  the message that we thought was spam that really was from your grandmother you can't sue us  which is probably good because you know in the heady days of our the spamming crazy yeah I was very  hard to get messages through  so  I don't know  where all this is going I know for a fact that spamming is once lessened are I know that email is better  OB that used to be are and yet you know we still see the rise of isolated networks you know Facebook  messaging you know and that sort of thing are are very very popular today I don't know what percentage  of internet communications over Facebook but it's it's non trivial  so what is the future of messaging I don't know certainly a company like Facebook is going to be dealing  with spam and a lot better way then obviously I could because I was using open source tools now where  space walking in them that they built their their system to not allow for spamming okay yeah that's  a that's an advantage that the person is using open you know internet doesn't necessarily have so we'll  see what the future brings but  I do know at the end of the day that are the people that you spamming got paid a lot more than the people  that fought spammers and and maybe that's changed a little bit now that there's only a number of smaller  players but this is not it was a very difficult role to be in and at the end of it was arms race and  frankly  in my case the spammers one like it costs too much primary I could maintain an arm and died outsourced  everything to the company and that was the end of that but  Microsoft Google other big mailers right are still in the game and are still looking for ways to defeat  the bottom that's thankfully bought notes of also discovered other ways to make money I'm others just  sending spam like that corn mining and other things so they're still evil they're just not bother you  as much so I guess that's I guess I'm not sure that's a plus or not  I'm so I'm going to stop here if anyone has any questions are a couple questions in the chat  this spam assassin and now it's just a snort for email  you could not  I'm not sure what star does for pattern recognition but I mean you start a number of years but it might  are what is Dee Dee cam standpoint stand for domain keys I don't know what the I am stands for that's  a good question  any other questions here  I want to thank you then for allowing me to go down this memory lane tonight and talk about some of  the challenges that are large volume email providers have as I said I'm not in this game anymore are  but I'm still very happy to talk to you about it and hopefully in a couple weeks we'll talk about some  games that I do play and and that'll be fun too so thank you and have a great evening  ", "captions": [{"text": "right hello good evening welcome or welcome back is that as the case may be are this is a guest lecture ", "begin": 1}, {"text": "for C.
