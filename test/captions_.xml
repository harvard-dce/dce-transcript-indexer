	<div xml:lang="en"><p begin="0:00:01.150" end="0:00:07.750">right hello good evening welcome or welcome back is that as the case may be are this is a guest lecture </p><p begin="0:00:07.750" end="0:00:13.820">for C. S. C. I. E. 40 are for November the well was 11/14/2017 when I'm recording this this video will </p><p begin="0:00:13.820" end="0:00:18.160">probably be re shown are for multiple years so </p><p begin="0:00:22.750" end="0:00:27.780">maybe that they won't mean anything to you but that's when we're recording it today this is our special </p><p begin="0:00:27.780" end="0:00:34.520">guest lecture on spam and email filtering are something that professor of in check are has asked me </p><p begin="0:00:34.520" end="0:00:38.340">to put together and I refresh this every couple of years </p><p begin="0:00:41.050" end="0:00:47.440">if you've already been attending my sections as you are our hope you are you should know a little bit </p><p begin="0:00:47.440" end="0:00:54.250">about me I've been doing this for too long I am a experts are I pretend to be an expert at least on </p><p begin="0:00:54.250" end="0:01:00.440">talking shooting and and such I've been right a teaching assistant for a very long time ABA perhaps </p><p begin="0:01:00.440" end="0:01:06.970">most importantly I have spent many years I don't currently do it but I have spent many years managing </p><p begin="0:01:06.970" end="0:01:13.380">industrial scale email systems are with up to like 30000000 email accounts so I have significant experience </p><p begin="0:01:13.380" end="0:01:23.200">dealing with email at an I. S. P. level and so the service check is asked me to come and talk to you </p><p begin="0:01:23.200" end="0:01:26.500">about some of what it takes to manage our email apps that scale and </p><p begin="0:01:30.960" end="0:01:35.720">I think it's a great opportunity for us to look at this a little bit differently it's a great opportunity </p><p begin="0:01:35.720" end="0:01:44.590">to kind of here behind the hood of how your favorite our email system our our provider might work and </p><p begin="0:01:44.860" end="0:01:49.630">indeed many of them especially if you're on the bigger ones they're gonna have their own secret fossel </p><p begin="0:01:49.630" end="0:01:55.800">talkies to about that but the fundamental concepts that I'm going to describe tonight are pretty similar </p><p begin="0:01:55.800" end="0:01:56.400">across </p><p begin="0:02:01.150" end="0:02:06.260">our system here are pretty similar regardless of the provider even if the actual tools of their using </p><p begin="0:02:06.260" end="0:02:08.210">our our our proprietary </p><p begin="0:02:10.020" end="0:02:16.080">so why do I talk about spam because initially professor of infectious asked me to say Hey Joe talk about </p><p begin="0:02:16.080" end="0:02:21.860">you know what scale and you know talk about email at scale is kind of boring you know Hey instead of </p><p begin="0:02:21.860" end="0:02:27.640">one mail server let's set up 30 right now it's it's skills out you know you need load balancers are </p><p begin="0:02:27.640" end="0:02:32.740">going to deal with our replication issues all that stuff and you know what I thought boring you don't </p><p begin="0:02:32.740" end="0:02:39.850">care on because the network class and what is really interesting lease is interesting to me is about </p><p begin="0:02:40.070" end="0:02:47.970">how we define our and defeat the spam epidemic and in many cases have defeated the spam academic keep </p><p begin="0:02:47.970" end="0:02:54.850">in mind that over the last 10 years the amount of spam as as decreased quite significantly thankfully </p><p begin="0:02:59.590" end="0:03:05.000">right to the point that only about 60 percent of messages today are considered spam you don't see them </p><p begin="0:03:05.000" end="0:03:11.480">because they end up in your trash folder or they don't get to it all most users only 0 to a small percentage </p><p begin="0:03:11.480" end="0:03:18.600">of the spam that comes in especially if using a pretty decent now provider OB but 60 percent of the </p><p begin="0:03:18.600" end="0:03:23.880">spare 60 percent messages being spared you're you're thinking wow that's so high and when I started </p><p begin="0:03:23.880" end="0:03:32.020">at this game when I was running it spam accounted for something close to 98 percent of the messages </p><p begin="0:03:32.020" end="0:03:33.660">that came in it was </p><p begin="0:03:37.310" end="0:03:44.140">mind boggling the awful the amount of infrastructure I had to support anti spam was substantially greater </p><p begin="0:03:44.140" end="0:03:49.140">than the amount of infrastructure I had to actually support running email for millions of users right </p><p begin="0:03:49.140" end="0:03:54.530">so this became a big deal for me as well the reasons I got out of the email business because it just </p><p begin="0:03:54.530" end="0:04:00.650">got too expensive but are none the less I'm hoping I can talk to about these techniques </p><p begin="0:04:02.740" end="0:04:08.800">if it wasn't for the work that I did are and the work that many others do </p><p begin="0:04:10.150" end="0:04:16.010">then you're in now would not be a functioning commodity today and the fact that it is as good as it </p><p begin="0:04:16.010" end="0:04:23.060">is is I think a testament to a lot of really smart people working on this problem for a long time I'm </p><p begin="0:04:24.270" end="0:04:28.380">and if you've attended by sections you've probably heard me talk about the tragedy of the Commons I </p><p begin="0:04:28.380" end="0:04:32.880">think I did talk about it this year and the tragedy of the Commons is really where </p><p begin="0:04:35.590" end="0:04:42.420">spam right I I think a spam as one of these tragedies or the Commons is email everyone can use email </p><p begin="0:04:42.420" end="0:04:49.750">and if a couple of spammers start figuring out and they can send out messages there's no impact crater </p><p begin="0:04:49.750" end="0:04:50.540">Commons is </p><p begin="0:04:52.650" end="0:04:57.730">an office wide enough you know everyone has plenty of grass to graze on end of a couple people are cheating </p><p begin="0:04:57.730" end="0:05:00.610">by sending out spam messages well sorry </p><p begin="0:05:02.230" end="0:05:02.490">what </p><p begin="0:05:03.320" end="0:05:09.380">if everyone send out spam or everyone abuses the Commons right and so I think in the comments that you're </p><p begin="0:05:09.380" end="0:05:11.780">grazing coats of one person bring the goat </p><p begin="0:05:13.060" end="0:05:18.180">great that's houses right if if one person brings to go to other cheating the system but the Commons </p><p begin="0:05:18.180" end="0:05:24.170">is fine but if everybody brings 2 goats than the Commons gets overgrazed and ecosystem collapses the </p><p begin="0:05:24.170" end="0:05:30.730">grass isn't growing nobody can feed their goats similarly if everyone sends out spam and spam isn't </p><p begin="0:05:30.730" end="0:05:37.060">that with an email stops becoming a viable method of communicating and then everyone stops using email </p><p begin="0:05:37.060" end="0:05:43.110">and in fact that's where we were if you go back to 2007 or so as damages becomes so terrible </p><p begin="0:05:45.760" end="0:05:49.600">that it was hard to do any real work for you to start </p><p begin="0:05:50.440" end="0:05:54.650">you remember back in those days right at sites better now mostly better now </p><p begin="0:05:55.970" end="0:05:56.430">I'm </p><p begin="0:05:57.270" end="0:06:02.720">before we go there I do want to talk I should just mention definitions right are this is a standard </p><p begin="0:06:02.720" end="0:06:08.570">definition of spam it's still pretty good spam is balk messages that are unsolicited </p><p begin="0:06:11.570" end="0:06:18.780">so if you send in unsolicited message you're not streaming so if I send a message to you just saying </p><p begin="0:06:18.780" end="0:06:27.440">hi I sent a message to my doctor saying Hey I have some I need some advice you know and it hurts when </p><p begin="0:06:27.440" end="0:06:34.270">I do this right those messages are unsolicited I if I send a message to our person asking about an apartment </p><p begin="0:06:34.270" end="0:06:39.390">right that's not so well that might be a solicitor message but it might not be that's fine all that's </p><p begin="0:06:39.420" end="0:06:39.590">fine </p><p begin="0:06:41.830" end="0:06:49.870">messages are often far I run a mailing list for a little league team I run a a form that people can </p><p begin="0:06:49.870" end="0:06:58.150">ask me IT questions right those you know those are fine uses of bulk mailing you know there's an all </p><p begin="0:06:58.150" end="0:07:02.960">employees listed my company football now hopefully no one exposes it to the outside world </p><p begin="0:07:04.850" end="0:07:05.340">hopefully </p><p begin="0:07:06.280" end="0:07:09.460">what are unsolicited bulk mail is </p><p begin="0:07:10.500" end="0:07:17.530">right if you send a message to multiple people and that they didn't ask for it that is spam by the definitions </p><p begin="0:07:17.530" end="0:07:19.520">that where that we're talking about </p><p begin="0:07:27.930" end="0:07:33.110">you might have heard some of these other definitions unsolicited bulk email unsolicited commercial email </p><p begin="0:07:33.370" end="0:07:39.600">I don't care I still say Sam I think Hormel is probably not liking the fact that I still say spam but </p><p begin="0:07:39.600" end="0:07:44.180">they don't personally care because I'm just a small fry never wants to call the spam but </p><p begin="0:07:46.310" end="0:07:49.610">I've given that you will have heard some other terms here I'm </p><p begin="0:07:50.650" end="0:07:52.500">you might be surprised to learn </p><p begin="0:07:53.250" end="0:07:58.590">maybe you aren't because you're human and that you've become cynical and jaded by my conversations on </p><p begin="0:07:58.590" end="0:08:04.400">the last term that's been actually goes back a long way also here's a little bit of the history of you </p><p begin="0:08:04.400" end="0:08:10.470">now on 1960 to 1965 are more the very first email systems that were set up that could actually talk </p><p begin="0:08:10.470" end="0:08:15.660">to multiple computers right there were earlier email systems where you basically sent the message to </p><p begin="0:08:15.810" end="0:08:21.180">Joe and the next time Joe locked into that machine you could see it but in the early 19 sixties and </p><p begin="0:08:21.180" end="0:08:26.930">about internet mail or marketing call if that yet where you could send messages to people on other computers </p><p begin="0:08:26.930" end="0:08:29.260">and if you find some really old our messages </p><p begin="0:08:33.330" end="0:08:38.110">by the use Bangkok addressing right go to this computer that this computer that this computer and I </p><p begin="0:08:38.309" end="0:08:45.310">talked to Joe there as as Kevin interesting system the first network email was invented completely networking </p><p begin="0:08:45.440" end="0:08:52.680">I was 1966 on 1969 email was expanded to work over the arpanet are 1971 the outside was invented before </p><p begin="0:08:52.680" end="0:08:57.770">that I don't know what they did but I was pretty boring 1971 the original mailbox protocol but 1978 </p><p begin="0:09:05.210" end="0:09:10.690">same here same here is me I'm trying we're gonna admit that I I was born around the same time as spam </p><p begin="0:09:10.950" end="0:09:12.080">coincidence </p><p begin="0:09:12.980" end="0:09:20.720">I'm not sure 1978 the first fan mail was sent advertising equipment for Jack Digital Equipment Corporation </p><p begin="0:09:20.840" end="0:09:23.090">are here it is </p><p begin="0:09:24.860" end="0:09:29.380">this will be giving a product presentation the newest member of the Texas some 20 family the next system </p><p begin="0:09:29.380" end="0:09:37.180">2020 wow I want to go find out all about this at the Hyatt house in Los Angeles on Tuesday 5/9/1978 </p><p begin="0:09:37.180" end="0:09:44.500">oops I'm not born yet this is the first and now I I don't believe they were they were writing in all </p><p begin="0:09:44.500" end="0:09:49.310">caps because they were shouting I think at this point now systems were absent EC and they probably work </p><p begin="0:09:49.310" end="0:09:55.540">all they probably only had caps to work with or maybe they didn't I'm not sure but regardless it is </p><p begin="0:09:55.540" end="0:10:01.700">in all caps and now you can tell your friends you have seen the very first fan mail ever sent and I </p><p begin="0:10:01.700" end="0:10:07.990">hope this makes you interested in the product because now there's hundreds of thousands of other spam </p><p begin="0:10:07.990" end="0:10:13.250">mails I you may have been surprised actually the first band I wasn't for like some herbal supplement </p><p begin="0:10:13.250" end="0:10:13.490">but </p><p begin="0:10:18.780" end="0:10:24.070">back in those days they had they're different interests I think and a different market if you know who </p><p begin="0:10:24.070" end="0:10:28.560">is actually on the internet right if I'm not mistaken this was actually sent just not everyone on the </p><p begin="0:10:28.560" end="0:10:29.170">internet at the time </p><p begin="0:10:32.290" end="0:10:38.140">10 very many I I don't actually know probably in the hundreds but </p><p begin="0:10:41.340" end="0:10:47.350">600 right that I write 600 if I wrote 600 I'm a smart person yes I wrote 600 thank you for reminding </p><p begin="0:10:47.990" end="0:10:56.250">you of my own material on thank you hi name and the real Spanish you started in 1992 as are weak people </p><p begin="0:10:56.250" end="0:11:00.560">got into like AOL and compuserve and prodigy and that sort of thing </p><p begin="0:11:04.900" end="0:11:12.440">I am continue to rise into 2010 and we're now down to 2017 with the Spanish continuing to decline and </p><p begin="0:11:12.440" end="0:11:20.760">here's a nice graph of this actually ends in 2011 I believe so it actually it's quite a bit smaller </p><p begin="0:11:20.760" end="0:11:29.620">now even than not but I like this graph because it actually shows you some of the patterns are a little </p><p begin="0:11:30.040" end="0:11:35.390">bit visibly as different spamming or organizations were temporarily shut down and then they come back </p><p begin="0:11:35.390" end="0:11:38.250">and then they send some more but </p><p begin="0:11:42.440" end="0:11:43.770">I think we're down here now </p><p begin="0:11:44.720" end="0:11:48.900">terms of the amount of spam that sent which is no where I mean look at this that's </p><p begin="0:11:50.380" end="0:11:55.940">yes this is where I was right this is this is the period where I was running now and I picked the wrong </p><p begin="0:11:55.940" end="0:12:00.550">time to be in that business I'll tell you what what it was a good business </p><p begin="0:12:02.050" end="0:12:06.110">actually connecting people you know Sir and it's connecting people </p><p begin="0:12:07.920" end="0:12:13.430">so the big challenge with spam is always of the numbers are huge right even now the numbers are huge </p><p begin="0:12:13.460" end="0:12:14.830">estimated 2200000000000 email messages sent </p><p begin="0:12:18.080" end="0:12:25.110">per day I think that number is higher now but try to find an estimate online you will you'll fail because </p><p begin="0:12:25.110" end="0:12:26.890">they will just give you wildly inaccurate numbers </p><p begin="0:12:30.820" end="0:12:37.860">bottom line is the numbers are pretty big and that spam spam accounts for 60 percent of those then we're </p><p begin="0:12:37.860" end="0:12:39.230">talking pretty big </p><p begin="0:12:41.060" end="0:12:42.610">but we're just hams come from </p><p begin="0:12:44.430" end="0:12:47.780">and the answer is probably not surprising to you because you live </p><p begin="0:12:48.710" end="0:12:53.790">in 2017 and you hear about the stuff on the news it doesn't really come from commercial email systems </p><p begin="0:12:53.790" end="0:13:01.520">although there are some I had some great partnerships over the years with our block mailers and I can </p><p begin="0:13:01.520" end="0:13:06.940">tell you that they were always on the up and up and always dealing with options and and everything I've </p><p begin="0:13:06.940" end="0:13:11.930">I've I've known some that were less legitimate but I never worked with them on a really that accounts </p><p begin="0:13:12.540" end="0:13:16.340">for teeny tiny little swaths of the of the spam </p><p begin="0:13:19.170" end="0:13:27.030">a lot more of the spam comes from historically has come from compromise systems either open mail relay </p><p begin="0:13:27.030" end="0:13:33.690">arm and abused by S. P. right somebody over there really isn't open but somebody's using the Comcast </p><p begin="0:13:33.690" end="0:13:39.040">no relay in order to send out their messages and now the big thing of course </p><p begin="0:13:40.560" end="0:13:40.970">is finance </p><p begin="0:13:42.880" end="0:13:49.550">right and what not so are in the news a lot more today than they were 5 or 6 years ago when I was first </p><p begin="0:13:49.550" end="0:13:52.700">getting into this business or when I was dealing with this stuff </p><p begin="0:13:54.020" end="0:13:59.660">cop what nature you know their compromise systems you running malware on your machine and the people </p><p begin="0:13:59.660" end="0:14:03.710">that wrote them our have to decide what they want your machine to do they probably aren't going to just </p><p begin="0:14:03.710" end="0:14:08.820">trash it although some botnets do maybe they're gonna do that quite mining because that's pretty popular </p><p begin="0:14:08.820" end="0:14:09.450">today but </p><p begin="0:14:11.780" end="0:14:20.210">it out spamming is also a completely valid use of a net for person for interesting definitions of of </p><p begin="0:14:20.740" end="0:14:21.960">valid uses yes Sir </p><p begin="0:14:23.210" end="0:14:30.000">fishing this or as well unsolicited issue is a high </p><p begin="0:14:31.260" end="0:14:36.510">right so a person that is spamming how can have multiple objectives right they're trying to sell you </p><p begin="0:14:36.510" end="0:14:36.990">something </p><p begin="0:14:37.960" end="0:14:43.500">they're trying to hack you in some way like they're trying to get you to go to a compromise system where </p><p begin="0:14:43.500" end="0:14:50.030">to download a update your flash right you know what you know what's popular today and </p><p begin="0:14:52.680" end="0:14:58.250">or they're gonna try it out for you like Hey this is bank of America and you need to update your account </p><p begin="0:14:58.250" end="0:15:02.390">information please click here and you know it's really bank of America. </p><p begin="0:15:03.760" end="0:15:09.210">something something got are you and you know you go there and

future brings but </p><p begin="0:52:11.910" end="0:52:17.600">I do know at the end of the day that are the people that you spamming got paid a lot more than the people </p><p begin="0:52:17.600"
